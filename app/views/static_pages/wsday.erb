				<h1>World Spine Day</h1>
					<p>Every year on October 16th people from around the world join together to raise awareness on World Spine Day as part of the Bone and Joint Decadeâ€™s Action Week.</p>
					<p>Spinal disorders represent a global health care crisis, affecting over a billion people worldwide and contributing more to the global burden of disease than HIV, more than malaria, more than diabetes, more than stroke, more than lung and breast cancer combined.</p>
					<p>World Spine Care has teamed up with World Spine Day and the Bone and Joint Decade to raise funds to bring spine care to communities in need. </p>
